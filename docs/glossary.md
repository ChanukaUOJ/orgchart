## Democratic Socialism
Democratic socialism describes a socialist economy where production and wealth are collectively owned, but the country has a democratic system of government. The goal is to achieve equality while opposing socialist ideologies. Democratic socialism is opposed to the Soviet economic model, command economies, and authoritarian governance. Under democratic socialism, private property is limited and the government regulates the economy.
